We're reviewing a dataset that is a real combination of San Francisco Police Department crime documentation. It includes the periods from 2003 to 2017 and is quite comprehensive, with each analysis providing the overall assessment of the city's security over that period. This dataset gives us detailed insights into various incidents, including where they started, when they happened, and other specifics such as the communities where this specific incident occurred. We have been analyzing this to figure out patterns and analyze variations in crime over the years. Bringing all of it altogether will show a broader picture of offense in San Francisco.

Here we have a bar chart which represesnts the cumilitive number of crimes per year from 2003 to 2017 which gives us some kind of idea how the crimes has happened over the years. From the start of the recorded period in 2003, there were over 140,000 incidents. The crime incidents showed a decrease in subsequent years, dipping to just above 120,000 by 2009. After a slight uptick around 2010, there was a noticeable decrease, reaching the lowest point on the chart in 2011 with fewer than 120,000 incidents. However, from this point, there was a steady increase over the next few years. In 2016, the number of incidents rose above the earlier peak in 2004, surpassing 140,000.

We tried to dive a little deeper by analyzing it geographical point of view where we found that Souther District has been the hottest zone for crime in San Fransiscro. There seems like a common pattern in all the districts where we could see that Theft/Larnecy is the most occured crime except for Tenderlion where Drugs and narcotics peaked the chart.

Amongst all the crimes we tried to get a better visualization of few crimes which had the significant amount of changes of the year. And here is what we have found:

The latest data up to 2017 has shown that larceny/theft, the most common of urban crimes, has been on a relentless upward trend, surging past 30,000 incidents annually. This persistent challenge has prompted a multi-faceted response from the city, including the deployment of more foot patrols and community policing initiatives, which have begun to show promise in curbing the tide of theft.

Vehicle theft presents a different tale. After a peak in 2006 with over 14,000 incidents, concerted efforts by law enforcement, coupled with community awareness programs, have led to a significant reduction in cases, as depicted by the data's descending slope. Programs such as the San Francisco Police Department’s "Park Smart!" initiative advise residents and visitors on how to protect their vehicles, reflecting an approach that combines prevention with enforcement.


Drug/narcotic offenses have witnessed a downward trajectory, from highs of over 12,000 incidents to nearly half that number. This significant decrease can be largely attributed to San Francisco's progressive stance on drug policy and the introduction of harm reduction programs like the San Francisco Needle Exchange, which has not only helped reduce drug incidents but also the spread of infectious diseases.

Forgery/counterfeiting has had its ebbs and flows, albeit on a much smaller scale. The downward trend in recent years can be correlated with the increasing sophistication of banking security measures and the San Francisco District Attorney’s continued focus on financial crimes, ensuring that the integrity of the city's financial institutions remains intact.

At last we can say that crimes in San Fransisco is very dynamic as the city itself. Each statistic tells a story of challenges faced and overcome, and of a community's resilience in the face of adversity. As the city moves forward, the hope is that these downward trends will continue, painting a safer and more secure landscape for all San Franciscans.
